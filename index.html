		<div class="instructions">
			<p>Welcome to a demonstration of basic JS programming principles.  This game requires that you, the user, input a positive number.  From there, the program will take the number and print (read as "Append") every number between and your number to the DOM.  There are 3 caveats to that, however:</p>
			<div class="numbered">
				<p>1) If the number is divisible by 3, the word "Fizz" will be printed in place of the number.</p>
				<p>2) If the number is divisible by 5, the word "Buzz" will be printed in place of the number.</p>
				<p>3) Finally, if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the word "FizzBuzz" will be printed in place of the number.</p>
			</div>
			<p>So, type a number, press enter, and voila!</p>
